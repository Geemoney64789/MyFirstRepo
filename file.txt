This a new text file. 
Hello World.
I am once again pulling at this knotted mess which I have created.
Third times a charm they say. Ha!
Now I have created a new branch for this project.
The point being I can alter, modify, add to, or delete code from this branch without it ever affecting the main or original project. 
I would say call it a safe space to experiment with my project without damaging my original code. 
Atleast this is the way I have made it make sense in my mind.
